Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis for the publication entitled: [Molecularly targetable cell types in mouse visual cortex have distinguishable prediction error responses](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(23)00626-8.pdf).

**Please note** that this repository, even with the appropriate libraries and packages installed, will not operate independently. Due to size limitations, the **original datasets** are not included. However, for those who are interested, the *original published dataset* as well as the code are available [elsewhere](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8229544).

At the moment this README is still under construction, more details to follow.
